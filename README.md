# dotfiles
My custom dotfiles for stuff

So far just putting up bspwm stuff, my bspwm rc still needs work, its pretty sloppy
For polybar I use 2 scripts, one is from my set-wallpaper repo and another is from https://github.com/petternett/railway-statusbar/tree/main.
Oh, and the bspwm is mostly used for dual monitor (HDMI), it works by itself but its not used like that for me.
